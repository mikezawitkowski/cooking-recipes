# Basic Cabbage Coleslaw Recipe


I can't remember where I learned to do this recipe, but it's really simple.

## Ingredients

- Red or purple cabbage
- 1 carrot
- salt
- pepper
- italian seasonings
- olive oil (or, see alternative under tips)
- (optional) green cabbage


## Directions

- cut into the head of cabbage across it. Make slices as thin as practical
- cut up about 30-50% more than you think you are going to eat
- use a cheese grater to cut up the carrot
- heat up a cast iron skillet on low to medium
- when pan is hot, add a little oil, and once it's hot, throw in the ingredients
- throw in seasonings
- mix occasionally until it reduces down slightly
- serve immediately


## Tips

- This is great with fish!
- If you have the time and desire, you can reuse the pan with oil used for cooking, say, fish, and throw in the ingredients into that pan to make the coleslaw
- Don't be afraid to pile so many ingredients into the skillet that it seems to overflow. It doesn't take very long for the ingredients to lose moisture and decrease in volume.
