# Herb Butter Massaged Roast Turkey

I am sitting here on Thanksgiving Day 2019, killing time while the turkey roasts by writing up this favorite recipe.

At the time of this writing, the video on how to prep and roast turkey by Chef John of allrecipes.com has been viewed 1,548,174 times. I'm pretty sure about half of those views are mine. (Links to videos are below.)

I have systematically tortured my family the past five holiday seasons for both Thanksgiving and Christmas by playing this video on repeat, and laughing every time at the jokes.

"Most people are scared of cooking turkey...they're CHICKEN." (insert [drum sting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(percussion)))

Unfortunately, over the years, I've noticed that the links to the original recipes that I've nearly memorized have disappeared and replaced by sub-par versions, or user-contributed versions that are missing key steps.

Also, I've made a few mistakes of my own in following the original recipes that turned out really great and I want to document it for my future self.


Enjoy this recipe, and remember the words of Chef John: in life... "there is nothing worse than a burnt wingtip."

Happy Thanksgiving/Christmas/Holidays!



## Ingredients

*Includes herb better recipe ingredients*

* 2 tablespoons kosher salt
* 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
* 1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
* 1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and
* giblets reserved
* 2 onions, coarsely chopped
* 3 ribs celery, coarsely chopped
* 2 carrots, coarsely chopped
* 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 1/2 bunch fresh sage
* 1/2 cup butter
* 6 cups water
* 2 tablespoons turkey fat
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 3 cups turkey pan drippings
* 1/4 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (optional)
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
* salt and ground black pepper to taste


## Instructions

### Do these the night before

- Put a stick of unsalted butter out on the counter the night before to soften.
- Mix 2 tablespoons salt, and 1 tablespoon pepper, and 1 tbsp poultry seasoning in a small bowl.
- cut up the vegetable medley. Toss the onion, celery, and carrots together in a bowl.
- pick out the roasting pan
- set out the tools you'll need
- Calculate how early to wake up in order to get the turkey into the oven. Give yourself an hour, plus 18 minutes per pound of turkey, plus 45 minutes for the bird to rest before the meal is served.


### Morning of

- Get started one hour before the turkey must go into the oven
- Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

- Remove the neck, and bag of giblets from inside the turkey. Put all of the giblets except the liver into a pot with 6 cups of cold water, and set to simmer until you'll need it for turkey stock later. Simmer over medium heat for 2 hours.
- Bend (even break) the wings so that they tuck under the turkey and form a stable base. "There's nothing worse than a burnt wingtip." Plus, it makes a great stable base so you don't need all those fancy bird holding contraptions.
- Season cavity with about 1 tablespoon of the poultry seasoning mixture. Reserve remaining poultry seasoning mix.
- Stuff about 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture, rosemary sprigs, and 1/2 bunch sage into the cavity of the turkey. Tie legs together with kitchen string.
- Spread the remaining mix of cut-up carrots/celery/onion in the base of the roasting pan.
- Put the turkey on top of the vegetable medley.
- **Follow the instructions below, BUT, hold back about 1/3 of the dry seasoning mix for later. (This was a mistake I made one year when I forgot to sprinkle it on top of the buttered skin before adding aluminum foil)**
- Loosen the skin on top of the turkey breast using fingers or a small spatula. Place about 2 tablespoons butter under the skin and spread evenly. Spread the remaining butter (about 2 tablespoons) all over the outside of the skin, ioncluding the sides.
- Sprinkle the outside of the turkey with the half of the remaining poultry seasoning mix.
- Fill the pan with about 1/2 inch of water.
- Arrange sheet of aluminum foil over the breast of the turkey.
- Roast the turkey at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) at sea level for 18 minutes per pound.

***

- Two hours after having started the simmering of the turkey neck etc, strain the turkey giblets from the stock, and discard giblets. There should be at least 4 cups of stock.
- About halfway through the roasting process, for instance when you go to remove the aluminum foil, exclaim "Oh shoot! I forgot to add all the seasoning!" Then liberally sprinkle the rest of the seasoning across the top of the turkey and put back in. This will give it an herb crust that is amazing.
- An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Remove the foil during the last hour of cooking. Baste the turkey with the pan juices.

***

- Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Pour the pan juices, about 3 cups, into a saucepan and set aside. Skim off the turkey fat from the pan juices, reserving about 2 tablespoons.
- Heat 2 tablespoons of the turkey fat and 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Transfer the onion from the roasting pan into the skillet. Cook and stir until the onion is browned, about 5 minutes, then stir in the flour. Continue to cook and stir for about 5 minutes more; whisk in 4 cups of the skimmed turkey stock and the reserved pan juices until smooth; skim off any foam. Stir in the balsamic vinegar. Simmer until the gravy is thickened, whisking constantly, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon of chopped sage, and season to taste with salt and black pepper.

## The herb butter recipe:

~~http://homecooking.about.com/video/Holiday-Turkey-Butter.htm~~ This is wrong!

~~https://www.thespruceeats.com/perfect-turkey-compound-butter-recipe-101448~~ This one is close, except that it involves Chinese five spice? WTF?

OK, here's how to do the herb butter recipe it right:

### Ingredients

- 1 stick of unsalted butter, softened at room temperature enough to mix
- 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper
- 1 tsp poultry seasoning
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- 1 1/4 tsp salt (see tip about salt)
- about 1 tsp of chopped rosemary (or any spices you like)
- 2 cloves of fresh garlic, crushed


### Instructions

- Mix together the dry seasonings together
- Use a mortar and pestle to crush up the garlic and blend it with butter
- Add dry seasonings and keep mixing
- Add lemon zest and rosemary and mix it all together
- Use fingers and spatula to loosen up the skin of turkey
- Use a spoon and put about two tablespoons of butter under the skin on each side of turkey
- Massage the breast with your fingers to get it all the way along the breast
- Take the remaining butter from the mortar and with your hands smear it all over the outside of the skin of the turkey, including the sides of the breast and the legs


### Tips

- I sometimes use salted butter instead of unsalted. According to the internet, a stick of salted butter has about 1/4 tsp more of salt than a stick of unsalted butter, so I adjust the recipe accordingly.
- The key to remember with salt is that it will impact how much salt is used in the gravy later on, as it melts and falls into the drippings in the pan.
