## Crust

Finding gluten-free egg-free crusts is perhaps the hardest part of this recipe.

Here are some options:

- Use the French pantry gluten free pastry sheet
- Starting Thanksgiving 2019, we use Wholly Gluten Free(tm) Gluten Free 9" Pie Shell (see pic)
- You can make crust dough from scratch. (TODO: Make a crust from scratch and link the recipe here.)

*IMPORTANT: If you use upper crust pre-made crust, you need either double the amount of crust or one half as much filling, so adjust the receipt accordingly.*
