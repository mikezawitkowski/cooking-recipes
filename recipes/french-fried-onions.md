## Tips and Hacks

- On Thanksgiving 2019 I used Pamela’s baking and pancake mix made with almond meal instead of bob’s red mill. It turned out really well, if slightly lighter in color than we like.
- I used to have the fryer heat at 300-310 degrees, but after taking a cooking class at the Food Lab, and learning that frying is a dry form of a cooking that requires a specific temperature. A high temperature.
- In 2020, I've found that frying a batch for 4 minutes, and then letting the basket drip for 2 minutes is a good way of timing things
- I find that taking a "bases loaded" approach is the right approach. This means that I always want to make sure that I've got a floured amount of onions ready to pop into a basket, another batch that is dripping the extra buttermilk, and another batch that is sitting in buttermilk, soaking. If I move a batch to the flour stage, I need to also move all the other batches to the next phase. The slowest part about this whole thing is the frying, so we want a bit of a buffer right before that stage.
- In 2020, I found that 2-3 onions that went through a food processor created WAAAAY too many onions, like 3x more than we needed.
