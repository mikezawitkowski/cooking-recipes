I had been referring to it in the Evernote app, but the stupid app view refreshes every time my phone screen locks. This is very annoying when you are following along mid-way in a recipe and it refreshes back to the top!

Also, have you noticed that almost every recipe on the internet is prefaced with eight pages of back story about the author's journey to discover the recipe?

That's why I'm taking the time to write my own version of this recipe, keeping the best parts.

## Ingredients

* Center-cut salmon filet, 1-1½ pounds
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon pepper

## Instructions

- Place your cast-iron skillet into a cold oven and heat to 450ºF.
- When the pan is getting nice and hot, brush the salmon with olive oil and sprinkle with the salt and pepper.
- Once the oven has come up to temperature, remove the pan and lay the fish skin side down inside.
- With the salmon in place, return the skillet to the oven and cook uncovered for 14 to 18 minutes, or until a thermometer reads 125ºF.
- Remove from the pan and cut the salmon into single serving sizes.
