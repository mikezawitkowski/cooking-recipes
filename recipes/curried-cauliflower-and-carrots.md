# Curried Cauliflower and Carrots

* Prep: 10 min
* Cook: 40 min
* Total Time: 50 min


## Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons curry powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin
  * I didnâ€™t have this so i used:
    * 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
    * NOTE: Spouse asked for more turmeric
    * 1/2 teaspoon coriander3Q
* Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
* 1/3 cup olive oil, plus more for topping
* 1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
* 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
* 1 red onion, cut into eighths
* (optional) 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley


## Directions

- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
- Whisk together the curry powder, cumin, salt, pepper and olive oil in a medium bowl.
- Spread the cauliflower, carrots, and onion in a single layer ~~on a large baking sheet-lined with tin foil.~~ **using two rectangular glass or ceramic baking pans with edges, and tent each pan with aluminum foil.**
- Drizzle with the dressing and toss so it is thoroughly coated.
- Roast the vegetables in the oven until tender and browned, about 40 minutes~~, stirring halfway through cooking~~.
- Remove to a serving bowl and sprinkle with parsley and a drizzle of olive oil on top.
- Serve hot or at room temperature.


## Cooking notes:

- 6/26/2017 Trying without the aluminum foil
- 6/20/2020 Because we are at a higher altitude that is more dry, we noticed the veggies were drying out more. So, now we don't use aluminum foil on the bottom and leave open. Instead we cover the top to prevent it from drying out.
