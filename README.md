# cooking-recipes

We talk a lot about recipes and cookbooks when we talk about writing code. However, these are recipes for cooking, not coding.

This is born out of some frustrations:

- I'm tired of making changes to recipes and losing track of the latest version after Apple pie trial version number twenty-seven.
- I'm frustrated that recipe websites bombard me with adds as I try to remember if it was 1/2 a cup or a whole cup of flour to use in the recipe..
- I used to trust that a recipe would stay on the internet so long as the site was there, but too many times the link breaks and I would lose where it went.

Ultimately, I'm a little embarrassed I didn't do this sooner. I can't believe it took me this long to use proper version control.
